# persona’l
I have improved myself in many ways. So I am a Tree shape person. I have a `vantage point` of view. I always like to come up with new ideas and to be different. I want to turn `ideas` into products. And I am a good `problem solver`.

# techSkills

I've been a `mobile application business analyst` for the last 4 years. I am thinking about business processes, from designing to testing.

Also I am a technical person as I come from a technical `engineering background`.

Object oriented programming in any language and MVC or like architectural patterns are privileged for me. I’m interested in `Node.js` for web projects and apis, express.js, socket.io. etc. and `Mongodb` as nosql..

`Android development` that I used Kotlin with Firebase infrastructure. Also I had a little OpenCV experience  as native on Android.

Lately I'm training myself on `iOS development` using Swift and Swiftui.

Nowadays, I am very interested in `blockchain technology`. And developed my personal project ([Coffeepin](http://coffeepin.me){:target="_blank"}) on Avalanche platform, so I learned solidity and smart contract.
